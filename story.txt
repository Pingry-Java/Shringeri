Mr. S had arrived to dodooru only to find what he, deep down, knew was inevitable, the pang of lonieliness and despair.
He was welcomed by scorching plains of sand and caustic bugs, awaiting  his demise.
Worn down by the brutal desert elements, he collapsed upon the sand, beads of his sweat sizzling on the crust of granules.
Lying on the ground, dehydrated, nearing his last moments of life, he spotted a black scorpion, tail cocked, as if reaching out his hand to help him.
He felt a swell of hope, only to feel the sharp pain of the scorpion's sting.
And, thus, he was no more.
