Mr. S had arrived to dodooru only to find what he, deep down, knew was inevitable, the pang of lonieliness and despair.
He was welcomed by scorching plains of sand and caustic bugs, awaiting  his demise.
Worn down by the brutal desert elements, he collapsed upon the sand, beads of his sweat sizzling on the crust of granules.
Lying on the ground, dehydrated, nearing his last moments of life, he spotted a black scorpion, tail cocked, as if reaching out his hand to help him.
He felt a swell of hope, only to feel the sharp pain of the scorpion's sting.
And, thus, he was no more.

On Easter morning, Shringeri's family approached his tomb nervously. With tears forming in their eyes, they mourned his death, 
cursing their unfortunate fates. They turned around and went home. As soon as they were a far enough distance away, Shringeri emerged
from his tomb, laughing. His spirit was possessed the god of Bananas.

He slowly turned his head toward his family. The white apparition that once stood in front of them became a red
ghost consumed in flames. But rather than bending beneath the power of fire, Shringeri's ghost multiplied in size and the 
shrill of burning became loud enough to burst one's ear drums.
The flames fully engulfed Shringeri's family, and the fiery spirit grew quiet so as to make the family's screams
even louder and more horrifying. All that was left was ashes and regret.
And Bananas.
