Mr. S had arrived to dodooru only to find what he, deep down, knew was inevitable, the pang of lonieliness and despair.
He was welcomed by scorching plains of sand and caustic bugs, awaiting  his demise.
Worn down by the brutal desert elements, he collapsed upon the sand, beads of his sweat sizzling on the crust of granules.
Lying on the ground, dehydrated, nearing his last moments of life, he spotted a black scorpion, tail cocked, as if reaching out his hand to help him.
He felt a swell of hope, only to feel the sharp pain of the scorpion's sting.
And, thus, he was no more.

On Easter morning, Shringeri's family approached his tomb nervously. With tears forming in their eyes, they mourned his death, 
cursing their unfortunate fates. They turned around and went home. As soon as they were a far enough distance away, Shringeri emerged
from his tomb, laughing. Beside him was the vengeful spririt of Banana.
